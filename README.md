========

Library program to help schools in poor areas have access to knowledge - this program will also be sold by IncredibleSoftwaresolutions to those who can afford to pay so that development costs can be covered. 

If you take the code, please do submit your changes back to the tree.

It will also eventually be built in every major platform such as joomla, drupal et al.

Please feel free to build plugins once the base framework is complete or add your suggestions.

The idea is to build an online library do that real books can also be taken out of a real library and if they do not have the books, then an e-book to be 'booked out' to the childs 'account' is provided if the real book has already been taken out by another student learner.

This decription is a guide of where we will go with this program and what the plan is. Any requests will also be added here.
